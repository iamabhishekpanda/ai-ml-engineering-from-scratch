# The README use rule and the law

> You analyze a program only when you have the right to, and in this manual that right comes from writing every target yourself.

A vendor sent you a binary, and an agent at your side can decompile it in eight seconds. Before the first command, two questions stand. Who owns the program, and what does the law allow you to do with a copy you did not write? rea asks neither question. Its `DISCLAIMER.md` puts the answer on you, and the statutes and decisions below say what the answer has to contain.

When you finish this section, you can say which rule lets you analyze a program, and why every target in this manual passes that test. This section reads primary sources and gives no legal advice.

## The use rule at the tag

```rule
label: the use rule
source: readme DISCLAIMER.md, Responsible use
---
"You are responsible for obtaining any required authorization and for complying with applicable laws, license agreements and terms of service. Reverse engineering may be restricted in your jurisdiction or by the license of the software you analyze."
```

The rule is a paragraph under the heading `Responsible use` in `DISCLAIMER.md` at the tag. The README has a `Disclaimer` heading that sends you to that file. It also says: "REA is for lawful research, education, interoperability, software preservation, and analysis of software you own or are authorized to examine." {{readme Disclaimer}} It adds that this position covers all REA versions and distribution channels.

`DISCLAIMER.md` also lists the uses that the project does not support. The first item is the circumvention of DRM, licence checks, anti-cheat systems, and other protection measures. Then come game cheats, the bypass of authentication or access controls, and copies of proprietary software. The last two items are the evasion of AI provider usage policies and the resale or sharing of AI accounts.

## United States: 17 U.S.C. 1201

**Circumvention:** under 1201(a)(3)(A), "to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner" {{law 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(3)(A)}}. Section 1201(a)(1)(A) forbids it.

Section 1201(f) is the reverse engineering exception, and it stacks four limits. The person must have "lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program". The circumvention must be "for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs". Those elements must "have not previously been readily available to the person". The acts must not "constitute infringement under this title" {{law 17 U.S.C. 1201(f)(1)}}.

Section 1201(f)(4) defines the key word: "the term 'interoperability' means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged." {{law 17 U.S.C. 1201(f)(4)}}. Section 1201(j) covers security testing, which it defines as "accessing a computer, computer system, or computer network, solely for the purpose of good faith testing, investigating, or correcting, a security flaw or vulnerability, with the authorization of the owner or operator" {{law 17 U.S.C. 1201(j)(1)}}.

Section 1201(f) is an exception to the anti-circumvention rule only. It does not decide whether the copies you make while analyzing infringe copyright. Section 1201(c)(1) leaves that question to copyright law: "Nothing in this section shall affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use" {{law 17 U.S.C. 1201(c)(1)}}. The two decisions below answer it.

## European Union: Directive 2009/24/EC

Article 1(2) sets the ground: "Ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive." {{law Directive 2009/24/EC Article 1(2)}}. Two articles then give a lawful user two rights.

Article 5(3) is the right to study a running program: "The person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be entitled, without the authorisation of the rightholder, to observe, study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program if he does so while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do." {{law Directive 2009/24/EC Article 5(3)}}. The Court of Justice applied it in C-406/10. There a licensee studied the SAS System to reproduce its functionality in a second program, without decompilation, and did not infringe.

Article 6(1) is the decompilation right. It needs no authorisation "where reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning of points (a) and (b) of Article 4(1) are indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs" {{law Directive 2009/24/EC Article 6(1)}}. Three conditions follow. First, the acts are done by a person with a right to use a copy. Second, "the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously been readily available" {{law Directive 2009/24/EC Article 6(1)(b)}}. Third, "those acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are necessary in order to achieve interoperability" {{law Directive 2009/24/EC Article 6(1)(c)}}.

Article 6(2)(c) then forbids using the result "for the development, production or marketing of a computer program substantially similar in its expression" {{law Directive 2009/24/EC Article 6(2)(c)}}. A contract cannot take these rights away. Article 8 says: "Any contractual provisions contrary to Article 6 or to the exceptions provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) shall be null and void." {{law Directive 2009/24/EC Article 8}}. In C-13/20 the Court added a third route. A lawful purchaser can decompile to correct errors under Article 5(1), without the Article 6 conditions, but "only to the extent necessary to effect that correction" {{law C-13/20 ruling 2}}.

## Two decisions: Sega v. Accolade and Sony v. Connectix

In Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), Accolade bought a Genesis console and cartridges, disassembled the object code, wrote a manual of interface requirements, and then wrote its own games. The court held: "where disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law." {{law Sega v. Accolade, 977 F.2d at 1527-1528}}. The only code Accolade kept was a header of 20 to 25 bytes that the console required.

In Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000), Connectix copied the PlayStation BIOS into memory many times while it built an emulator that contained none of Sony's code. The court held: "The intermediate copies made and used by Connectix during the course of its reverse engineering of the Sony BIOS were protected fair use, necessary to permit Connectix to make its non-infringing Virtual Game Station function with PlayStation games." {{law Sony v. Connectix, 203 F.3d 596}}.

The court listed four ways to reach the functional elements of a program. Two of them are the static examination of the instructions and the dynamic examination of a running program, and it called both disassembly. Both decisions protect the intermediate copies and say nothing about copied code in the finished product.

kind: decision
title: five questions before the first command
claim: Five questions from 17 USC 1201(f), Directive 2009/24/EC, Sega, and Connectix stand before the first command, and the fixtures of this manual answer all five by construction.
caption: Read the five questions from the top down, and follow a dashed rose arrow at the first no. The references are the statutes and decisions in the Sources line, and the file names come from capture/out/00-fixtures.txt.

## The rule of this manual

Every target in this manual is a program written for it. `ledger.c` and `ledger-main.c` are the C sources, `js-app/` is a six-file application, and `wasm/ledger.wat` is a hand-written module. The capture kit records their hashes and sizes:

```listing
title: the fixtures and their hashes
source: capture/out/00-fixtures.txt
lang: text
note: Cut to the two C sources, the two arm64 executables, the module, and its text. The object files, the JavaScript files, and the smoke-test program are cut.

01b5d08b…   33872  fixtures/ledger-arm64-O1
…
8bbbaa58…   33872  fixtures/ledger-arm64-O2
…
80af384b…     743  fixtures/ledger-main.c
…
4564c3e7…     568  fixtures/ledger.c
…
699f6ff7…     290  fixtures/wasm/ledger.wasm
2e0b5792…    1841  fixtures/wasm/ledger.wat
```

For these files the five questions in [figure](#fig-2-1) answer themselves. You hold the copy because you compiled it. The purpose is study. No other way is needed because the source is beside the binary, and the comparison of the two is the point. The whole program is yours, so the parts and the expression are yours.

This manual never analyzes a protection, a licence check, an anti-tamper scheme, a game, or a program you do not own. It never instruments a running program other than its own fixtures.

For any other program, answer the five questions first and write the answers down. Start from a copy you obtained lawfully. Name the purpose the law names. The law names interoperability under 1201(f) and Article 6, study under Article 5(3), and error correction under Article 5(1). It also names security testing with the owner's authorization under 1201(j).

Check that the facts are not already published. Confine the work to the parts you need, and make the final product your own expression. Where a licence or a contract says more, read it. Section 1201(f) does not override contract law, and Article 8 voids only terms contrary to Articles 5(2), 5(3), and 6.

```takeaways
- Read `DISCLAIMER.md` once. Getting authorization is your task, and rea does not check it.
- Write down the lawful copy, the named purpose, and the missing facts before the first command.
- Analyze only programs you wrote or are authorized to examine, as every section of this manual does.
- Keep intermediate copies for analysis, and keep copied code out of anything you release.
